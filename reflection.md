What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I did not really use borders in this challenge to help position my elements. However, in an effort to learn more about padding and magin, I used the two pretty much interchangeably to see if it would make a difference in appearance. I think because I didn't use border, I wasn't able to see any difference between the padding and margin.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that this stuff is pretty tricky at first! There are a lot of factors to get right and if there is a single error at any stage everything gets messed up. That's why browser dev tools are really nice because they give us the ability to instantly see if our code is functioning and looking how we want it to. 

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The stylistic changes were pretty easy to implement because there isn't much room for error. Positioning elements correctly is definitely the most difficult because this is much more complex and dependent on other elements as well. 

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that you have to patient and be willing to try out a lot of different things. Because there are so many variables for adding and formatting elements, it is important to play around with them and see how you can achieve your goal in a simple manner.
