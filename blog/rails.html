<p>Rails, a.k.a. Ruby on Rails, is a web application framework coded in Ruby under the MIT license. David Heinemeier Hansson, through his work at web application company BaseCamp, developed Rails and subsequently released it in July 2004. This framework is model-view-controller, which was traditionally used for graphical user interfaces but here it supports web development. Rails follows web standards for display, user interfacing, and data transfer.</p>
<p>Let's expand a bit on the idea of model-view-controller. A model in Rails signifies a relation between a class defined in a Ruby file and a database. The database will then hold information for the different instances of the Ruby class. The controller portion of this framework acts as communication between the web server and the application. Web browsers send requests to the controller and they are processed if the appropriate routes are set up in the Ruby file. This process culminates in handing a view file to the web browser. Finally, a view is an embedded Ruby file which is translated to HTML when it is requested by a web browser.</p>
<p>With regard to web standards, what this means is that display and user interfacing are coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while data transfer is typically handled by JSON or XML. These standards relate to our model-view-controller framework in an intimate way. The views which our controller outputs are in erb parsed into HTML with CSS stylesheets. JSON allows us to achieve communication between the server and browser in real time without relying on browser plugins. These coding languages are very widespread and robust, so Rails incorporates them for convenience and functionality.</p>
