<h1>The Nuances of Array and Hashes</h1>
<section id="post">

<p>Arrays and hashes are two data types we can use to store vast amounts of information. An array is very flexible because we can store a wide variety of objects inside of it, and we can also store multiple object types in a single array! Elements of an array are index by integers in ascending order, beginning with 0. We typically initialize an array using the following code:
</p>
our_array = [1,3,"Peter"]
<p> A hash is a series of key/value pairs where every key points to a unique value. Hashes are valuable when we have an object with a number of variable properties. For example, if we are creating a database which stores the address, age, and gender of someone it might be a good idea to use hashes. The syntax for hashes is a bit more complex, and the following code provides an example:
</p>
characteristics = {age: 27, gender: "Male", address: "Berkeley"}
<p>Both arrays and hashes are very valuable and useful data types that I am sure I will learn a lot more about in the coming weeks.
