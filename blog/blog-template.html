How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I was the navigator for the wireframe portion of the assignment. This 
meant that I mostly watched my pair build up the prototype as I looked 
into examples of other blog wireframes. When she was finished with her 
idea of what the wireframe should look like, I added some suggestions 
that I thought we needed to make our template blog page complete. For 
the HTML page, I was the driver. I used the my-berkshire-site.html file 
as a reference point, and I was able to use a lot of the code from here 
to help us build up this html file quickly and effectively. My pair was 
very helpful in making sure that we had fully incorporated all of the 
elements from our wireframe. If I was doing this on my own I probably 
would have left a thing or two out!

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, definitely it was helpful. With wireframing, we already get a 
pretty clear idea of what we want to code before we even begin. Coding 
in a vacuum is doable, but when we add a visual element to the process 
it definitely becomes streamlined.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

Keep it basic, essential, and functional. We identified what we wanted 
out of our blog page and then we added those elements in an user-friendly 
manner. It was important for us to have easy navigation to other parts of 
our site. Additionally, we both understood that this was a prototype and 
that adjustments will probably be made in the future, so there was no need 
to get everything absolutely perfect.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

We did not do anything new with semantic elements. However, through making
another html file, I gained a clearer understanding of what the html tags 
do and how html relates to CSS. I am ready to format my html!
