  <p>Designing and building my website has been a great learning experience. I have always been really interested in web development, and I have even built some websites before, but it was not until Phase 0 that I really went through all the fundamental steps of building and maintaining a website. Even though it has been a struggle to learn CSS format and positioning, I now have a good understanding of how it functions. I am really excited to implement jQuery into my webpages for a more dynamic user experience.</p>
  <p>The main concept that I have taken away from building a website is that it is really important to maintain a picture of the entire website from the beginning of the project. In the end, everything is connected (in terms of web pages), so if there is not a smooth flow between pages then people are not going to stay on my site for very long. This connectedness also applies to design elements as well, so I put a lot of emphasis on consistency in color schemes and feel throughout my website. Considering this is my first real web design project, I am very eager to engage in new challenges to expand my development knowledge. Onwards and upwards!</p>
