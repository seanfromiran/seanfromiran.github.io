      First off, let's talk about version control and its virtues. We love this principle because it gives code a lineage, the ability to see the what, when, and why of what we've written. These characteristics are important because coding is a very dense process, and when we add guidelines and regulations to this venture, we no longer have to rely on our faulty memories to pick right back up where we left off. Of course there is the pair or group programming aspect to consider as well, once others begin reviewing, correcting, and using our code, version control becomes essential. So let's look at how GitHub and git can help us acheive.

How does git help you keep track of changes?
    <p>
      Let's begin with git because this file management system works at the local level, and in some ways it is the precursor to GitHub. An essential tool within git is the branch feature. Branches allow us to create files temporarily in the directory we are working in. We can then experiment with the changes that we have made and only when we are happy with the end result of our code to we add new files or edits to our permanent directory. The commands for git are very simple and they allow you to quickly incorporate your temporary files as well as leave descriptive comments to help you document modifications. We use git to apply a careful and calculated approach to coding.

Why use GitHub to store your code?    
    <p>
      GitHub is a relative of git which resides in the online world. The two programs work together seamlessly, and once our git code has been commited to our local directory, we can "push" changes online for the world to see. We use GitHub because it makes collaboration and sharing code with others really easy. Also, it is free, which is very appealing!
